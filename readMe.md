Core OOP Principles
Classes and Objects: Classes are blueprints; objects are instances of these blueprints.
Inheritance: Allows a class to reuse the behavior of another (parent).
Encapsulation: Hides internal details, exposing only necessary interfaces.
Polymorphism: Allows the same interface to behave differently based on the context.
Abstraction: Hides complexity, exposing only relevant details to the user.
