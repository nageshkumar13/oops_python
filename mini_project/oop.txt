Here’s a mini-project implementing all OOP concepts. 
We'll create a Library Management System to manage books, users, and transactions 
(borrowing and returning books).

Step-by-Step Design
Classes and Objects:
Define Book, Member, and Library classes.
Inheritance:
Member class inherits from Person class to reuse attributes.
Encapsulation:
Hide library's book collection and transaction history, exposing methods to manage them.
Polymorphism:
Multiple Person types (Member and Librarian) with shared behavior like viewing books but unique behavior like borrowing/approving books.
Abstraction:
Abstract Person class defines shared behavior for Member and Librarian.


Explanation
Classes and Objects:

Book, Member, Librarian, and Library are classes.
Objects like book1, member, and librarian represent real-world entities.
Inheritance:

Member and Librarian inherit from the Person class, reusing shared properties (name, person_id) and implementing the role method differently.
Encapsulation:

Library keeps books and transactions as private attributes (__books and __transactions), accessible only through controlled methods (add_book, show_books, lend_book, etc.).
Polymorphism:

The role method behaves differently for Member and Librarian.
The show_role function dynamically identifies the role of different Person objects.
Abstraction:

The Person class defines the role method but doesn’t implement it directly, leaving subclasses (Member, Librarian) to provide specific implementations.
